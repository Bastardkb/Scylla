If you don't want to source the Elite-C adapter PCB, you can use the [printable shield adapter](https://github.com/Bastardkb/Skeletyl/blob/main/things/pro%20micro%20mount%20plate/pro%20micro%20mount%20plate%20v2.stl).

If you don't want to source the flexible PCBs, you can also use either amoebas or handwire.

If you want RGB, you will also need:

| Part name          | Amount | Link       |
| ------------------ | ------ | ---------- |
| SK6812 Mini-E LEDs | 58     | Aliexpress |
| Capacitor, 1uF          | 4      | 1206                                  |
| Resistor, 330Ohms       | 4      | 1206                                  |
| Wires                   |        | 28 AWG recommended, Black, Red, Color |
| Ribbon cables Flexstrip | 6      |                                       |

## Print the case

The STL files are included in this Github.
Feel free to use and modify them at length. The files are on a non-commercial license, so this is for personal projects only - please do not use those to sell them.

Please find detailed instructions on how to print the case on the online instructions linked below.

### Tent mount plate
This option allows the keyboard to be mounted to standard camera gear tripods and mounts.  
A 1/4 - 20 UNC 7.6 mm deep heat insert is needed.  

## Get a kit from BastardKB
